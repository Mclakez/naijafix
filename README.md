NaijaFix 🇳🇬

NaijaFix is a community-driven reporting platform that empowers citizens to report problems in their communities and track their resolution transparently.

From bad roads and broken streetlights to waste issues and public hazards, NaijaFix helps bridge the gap between citizens and responsible authorities.
